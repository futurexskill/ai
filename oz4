Ozone access management can be done using the following steps:

Create groups and users: The Ozone administrator can create groups and users, and assign appropriate permissions to them.
Assign permissions: The administrator can then assign specific permissions to groups and users for specific directories or files within the Ozone file system.
Audit and monitor: Ozone also provides auditing and monitoring capabilities to track access and changes to files and directories.
To build a front-end Ozone interface, the following steps can be taken using REST APIs:

Authenticate and authorize: The user will need to be authenticated and authorized using Kerberos and the Ozone access management system.
Retrieve user information: Retrieve the user's information, such as their user ID and group membership.
List directories: Use the Ozone REST API to list the directories that the user has access to.
Manage files: Use the Ozone REST API to upload, download, and manage files within the user's directory.
Audit and monitor: Use the Ozone REST API to retrieve audit and monitoring information.
