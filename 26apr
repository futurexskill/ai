The new semantic layer will provide Workbench users with access to different datasets through a fast and efficient data model. The external curated datasets integrated into the semantic layer will enhance the quality of data available to the users, allowing them to make more informed decisions. With built-in access control, the new semantic layer will also ensure the security of the data being accessed. Overall, the new semantic layer is expected to improve the efficiency, quality, and security of data analysis in Workbench, leading to better insights and outcomes for users.
