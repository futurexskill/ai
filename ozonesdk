Presently, data is stored by users on a NAS drive that can only be accessed from the edge drive.

Users are unable to use HDFS as a storage solution due to its current full storage capacity.

From a privacy standpoint, it is currently impossible to determine the content of files stored on HDFS and Edge/NAS.

There is no file or data retention and expiry system in place.

Enforcement of privacy policies is either difficult or overconstrained

The current Hadoop edge node hardware is not being used to its maximum capacity because there is no load balancing in place at present.

At present, the availability of Hadoop edge nodes is restricted, and the cost of Cloudera licensing for Hadoop edge nodes is expected to rise in the future. This makes GPUs too expensive with the current architecture.

Integrating cloud tools with NAS drives and edge nodes is not an easy process.
