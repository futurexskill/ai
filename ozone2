Create a Dockerfile that defines the image for your Ozone installation. Here's an example Dockerfile:
bash
Copy code
FROM openjdk:11-jdk

# Install necessary tools
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y wget

# Download and extract Ozone
RUN wget https://downloads.apache.org/hadoop/ozone/ozone-1.3.0/ozone-1.3.0.tar.gz && \
    tar -xvf ozone-1.3.0.tar.gz && \
    rm ozone-1.3.0.tar.gz

# Set Ozone home directory
ENV OZONE_HOME=/ozone-1.3.0

# Expose necessary ports
EXPOSE 9864 9866 9876 9880

# Start Ozone
CMD ["sh", "-c", "$OZONE_HOME/bin/ozone.sh start && tail -f /dev/null"]
This Dockerfile starts with the official OpenJDK 11 image, installs wget, downloads Ozone 1.3.0, sets the Ozone home directory, exposes the necessary ports, and starts Ozone with the ozone.sh start command.
Build the Docker image by running the following command from the same directory where you saved the Dockerfile:
Copy code
docker build -t ozone:1.3.0 .
This will create a Docker image called ozone:1.3.0 based on the Dockerfile.
Run the Docker container by running the following command:
yaml
Copy code
docker run -d --name ozone -p 9864:9864 -p 9866:9866 -p 9876:9876 -p 9880:9880 ozone:1.3.0
This will start a new Docker container named ozone, and map the container's ports to the corresponding ports on the host machine.
That's it! You should now have a running instance of Ozone in a Docker container. You can verify that Ozone is working by visiting http://localhost:9876 in a web browser, or by running the command docker logs ozone to view the container's logs.
