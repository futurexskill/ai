The Workbench Drive aims to provide secure and reliable object storage services to data engineers and data scientists across ABC Company. The primary goal is to offer a user-friendly interface that enables easy storage and analytics on target servers. The Drive will support on-premise Hadoop, K8S, and all other backend cloud systems where users want to store their data and source code to run analytics.

One of the most significant advantages of the Workbench Drive is its intuitive interface for accessing files from workbench notebooks and workflow systems. The user interface is designed to be easy-to-use, making it effortless for users to work with their data and files. Additionally, the Drive solution will be available through workbench SDK and API, allowing users to easily access and integrate with other applications.

Our enterprise Drive solution will feature robust security and governance capabilities to ensure data privacy and confidentiality. It will leverage built-in security measures such as Kerberos on Hadoop and restrict access to user workspaces through the interfaces. Additionally, the Drive solution will include advanced governance and tracking features to monitor user activity, manage data retention policies, and implement access controls.

The solution will also have advanced monitoring and reporting capabilities that provide real-time performance metrics, enabling administrators to detect potential issues and resolve them quickly.




Workbench will adopt a multi-faceted solution approach that covers all aspects of the data storage and analytics lifecycle.

A separate storage area (for example, an Ozone directory on the data warehouse) will be created, mapping to the user workspace, on which only the users of that workspace will have exclusive access control. They can modify all files and manage directories under the workspace root folder, but won't be able to delete the root workspace folder itself, on which only the admins will have full control. Similar techniques will be applied to other backend servers, such as K8S, as well as cloud systems like AWS. 


An intuitive and user-friendly interface will be built within the Workbench IDE that will make it easy for data engineers and data scientists to store and access their files, run analytics, and collaborate with their teams.

To ensure data privacy and confidentiality, security and governance features will be built, including authentication, authorization, encryption, access control, and audit logging. The approach used will vary depending on the backend runtime. For example, on the Hadoop data warehouse, security measures such as Kerberos, Access MC, and Workbench's own access control using workspace will be implemented. This will provide a layered approach to security and governance, helping to ensure the safety and integrity of data stored within the Workbench Drive.

To allow seamless integration with other applications, the Drive will be made available through the Workbench API, CLI, and SDK, enabling data analysts and scientists to extend the functionality of the Drive solution.
