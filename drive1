The Workbench Drive aims to provide secure and reliable object storage services to data engineers and data scientists across ABC Company. The primary goal is to offer a user-friendly interface that enables easy storage and analytics on target servers. The Drive will support on-premise Hadoop, K8S, and all other backend cloud systems where users want to store their data and source code to run analytics.

One of the most significant advantages of the Workbench Drive is its intuitive interface for accessing files from workbench notebooks and workflow systems. The user interface is designed to be easy-to-use, making it effortless for users to work with their data and files. Additionally, the Drive solution will be available through workbench SDK and API, allowing users to easily access and integrate with other applications.

Our enterprise Drive solution will feature robust security and governance capabilities to ensure data privacy and confidentiality. It will leverage built-in security measures such as Kerberos on Hadoop and restrict access to user workspaces through the interfaces. Additionally, the Drive solution will include advanced governance and tracking features to monitor user activity, manage data retention policies, and implement access controls.

The solution will also have advanced monitoring and reporting capabilities that provide real-time performance metrics, enabling administrators to detect potential issues and resolve them quickly.
