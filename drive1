To ensure proper privacy control, a classification process will be implemented within the Workbench Drive solution. This process will require users to specify the level of privacy control they wish to apply to their files, such as public or private, before they can be stored. This will help to ensure that sensitive data is not accidentally shared with unauthorized individuals or entities. Additionally, the privacy classification process will be integrated with the security and governance features of the Drive solution, ensuring that appropriate access controls are in place for each file based on its classification level.
