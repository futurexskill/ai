This code snippet first connects to the OZONE filesystem using the fs_uri variable, which should be set to the URI of your OZONE cluster and bucket.

The code then lists the files in the bucket using the ls method of the ozone_fs object.

Next, the code adds a new file to the bucket using the open_output_stream method and writes the contents to it.

The code then removes the file from the bucket using the delete method of the ozone_fs object.

The code then copies the contents of an existing file to a new file using the open_input_stream and open_output_stream methods of the ozone_fs object.

Next, the code renames the file using the rename method of the ozone_fs object.

Finally, the code deletes the file using the delete method of the ozone_fs object.



This command imports the fs module from the pyarrow package, which provides a Python interface to the OZONE FileSystem.
